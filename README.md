# Js-Calculator

This is a simple Vanilla JS calculator, built from scratch.  It can add, subtract, multiply, and divide strings of numbers, and output the value to the screen.  It can differentiate between whole and decimal numbers and adjust it's display accordingly.

May add additional functionality in the future.  As of right now, just a fun project to enhance my understanding of the logic necessary for such tools.
